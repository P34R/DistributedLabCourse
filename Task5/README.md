# "Baby" Blockchain Project 
Topic - digital assets and currencies (may be enhanced with various voting features in the future).
## Overview and purpose of the system
The goal of the project is to study in detail how the blockchain works and create a simplified version of the blockchain system for the relevant topic (coins).  
May be modified in the future.
## System content (system boundaries)
The system allows users to exchange a certain resource (coins) among themselves.  
_Under development (May be supplemented)_
## Potential interaction of the product (with other products and components)
Potentially, in this particular version of the product (which is conceived by the author), it is possible to redirect the input of the program and connect it to another system.  
This may be one option in the future, but right now it's the only option.
## Product features
_Under development (Will be supplemented)_
## Security Requirements
_Under development (Will be supplemented)_
## Characteristics of users
An end user is any person who wants to receive and exchange coins (within this system) with other users. In the future, the user may be able to choose his role (miner, validator, etc.)
## Restrictions
This system does not have a consensus as such and is not decentralized.  
The number of coins a user can have is limited by the maximum value of uint64 and cannot be negative.  

_Under development (Will be supplemented)_
