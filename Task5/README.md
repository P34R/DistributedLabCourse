# "Baby" Blockchain Project 
Topic - digital assets and currencies (may be enhanced with various voting features in the future).  

## Overview and purpose of the system
The goal of the project is to study in detail how the blockchain works and create a simplified version of the blockchain system for the relevant topic (coins).  
The project does not aim to create a frontend (most likely there will be something like CLI).  
The user has standard features (creating key pairs, creating and signing transactions, etc.) for more details read [Product features](https://github.com/P34R/DistributedLabCourse/tree/master/Task5#product-features).  
May be modified in the future.
## System content (system boundaries)
The system allows users to transfer a certain resource (coins) among themselves using transactions.  
There are no roles in this project, each user has an account with the same rights for everyone.  
The creation of blocks is centralized (It can be assumed that each user can become a block creator and receive coins to his account, or it may be implemented in other way).  
_Under development (May be supplemented)_
## Potential interaction of the product (with other products and components)
The project is conceived as independent, without interaction with others. 
Potentially, such interaction may appear (for example, by redirecting IO ) in the future, but at the moment this is not planned.
## Product features
The system consists of 7 classes: Hash, Signature, KeyPair, Account, Operation, Transaction, Block and Blockchain (at the planning stage, may be changed in future).  
**KeyPair** - according to the name, this is a key pair (public and private keys) class. Generated by the ECDSA algorithm.  
**Signature** - Signs a message with a digital signature using ECDSA algorithm.  

_Under development (Will be supplemented)_
## Security Requirements
Project utilizes ECDSA signature algorithm on secp256r1 curve.  

_Under development (Will be supplemented)_
## Characteristics of users
An end user is any person who wants to receive and transfer coins (within this system) with other users. In the future, the user may be able to choose his role (miner, validator, etc.)
## Restrictions
This system does not have a consensus as such and is not decentralized.  
The number of coins a user can have is limited by the maximum value of uint64 and cannot be negative.  
The maximum number of transactions in a block is not set (at the planning stage), but may be changed in future.
